Transactional memory (TM) is a new parallel programming mechanism that reduces the complexity of parallel programming. TM reduces parallel programming complexity by abstracting away the necessary synchronization mechanisms from the parallel code, allowing the programmer to write parallel applications without worry of deadlocks, livelocks or race conditions.

Transactional memory is an active research interest for many academic and industry institutions with many open questions about its behavior.

Boost.STM is a C++ lock-based software transactional memory (STM) library. Our approach to STM is to use only native language semantics while implementing the least intrusive, most type-safe object oriented solution possible.

[heading How to Use This Documentation]
[/====================================]

This documentation makes use of the following naming and formatting conventions.

* Code is in `fixed width font` and is syntax-highlighted.
* Replaceable text that you will need to supply is in [~italics].
* If a name refers to a free function, it is specified like this:
  `free_function()`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `()`   to indicate that it is a free function.
* If a name refers to a class template, it is specified like this:   `class_template<>`; that is, it is in code font and its name is followed by `<>`   to indicate that it is a class template.
* If a name refers to a function-like macro, it is specified like this: `MACRO()`;
  that is, it is uppercase in code font and its name is followed by `()` to   indicate that it is a function-like macro. Object-like macros appear without the   trailing `()`.
* Names that refer to /concepts/ in the generic programming sense are   specified in CamelCase.

[note In addition, notes such as this one specify non-essential information that provides additional background or rationale.]

Finally, you can mentally add the following to any code fragments in this document:

    // Include all of InterThreads
    #include <boost/stm.hpp>

    // Create a namespace aliases
    namespace bstm = boost::stm;
